# txrunner

txrunner is a very basic web application designed for manually running transactions using MetaMask or other web wallets.

## Usage

You can always access the application at [notcoffee418.github.io/txrunner](https://notcoffee418.github.io/txrunner/).

Before executing a transaction on the mainnet, it's recommended to build and simulate it using [Tenderly Simulation](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/simulate). The JSON input for the simulation is the same as what you'll use for the transaction.

## Features

- Approve tokens on any Ethereum-based network.
- Execute manual transactions on any Ethereum-based network.

## When Not to Use

If Tenderly introduces a feature to run simulated transactions directly, please open an issue so this repository can be archived and updated with the relevant information.
